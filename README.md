# ml-models-predict-loan-default
Compare 5 major ML models for Classification (Logistic Regression, KNN, Random Forest (RF), Support Vector Machine (SVM), Multi-layer Perceptron (ANN), based on how well they can predict whether a given loan will default. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) loan data from Lending Club (2007-2018) was used to evaluate whether a given loan will default using various features (characteristics of loan and borrower). We then use trained models to predict on a test dataset how many of the current loans will default by compareing models on accuracy, precision,recall, F-stats and kappa
